// Description of Device Driver:
//    Device driver for the Kyouko3 PCIe graphics card
//    featuring the ability to issue commands to draw triangles
//    via the FIFO queue and DMA buffers.

// Description of Shared Header:
//    Shared header for the Kyouko3 PCIe graphics card driver.

// Description of User Code:
//    User code for issuing commands to the Kyouko3 PCIe graphics card
//    in order to draw triangles.

// Usage:
//    To draw a triangle with commands issued through the FIFO,
//    run the program with a command-line argument of 0 (or no argument).
//
//    To draw 50,000 triangles with commands issued through DMA buffers,
//    run the program with a command-line argument of 1. The commands are
//    separated across 50 DMA buffer requests, each buffer holding the commands
//    to draw 1,000 triangles.
